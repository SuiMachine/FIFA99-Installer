FIFA 99 Alternative Installer
===========================================

An alternate installer for _FIFA 99_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer.

This project uses code from both [bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [_Grim Fandango Setup_](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
and [Triangle717's](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com).** LEGO Racers installer.

The installer comes also bundled with nGlide.
